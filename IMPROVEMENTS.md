# Improvement

------------------

There are lots of things which we could improve in UX perspective and UI as well.

1. There can be an advanced filter( i just added one input box for searching any text in list)
2. For sorting data, user somehow should understand this functionality is there and can use it
3. For icons(one color icons) we could use icons like icomoon or material icons instead of svg & png, using svg is better than png, and we need to use svg icons for colorful icons
4. For list of emails there should be a pagination
5. For attachment, should be clickable and somehow user should be able to download or preview them, and even in detail mode we can show attachments like other email services
6. There should be some actions for each row like maybe delete, reply, forward(quick actions)
7. There should be checkbox for each row, and some action as bundle(like delete multiple items)
8. There should be a category of emails, like archive or any custom category which user can define by his/her own
9. There can be other preview of list, like split view(same as other email services)
